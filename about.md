Hi, I'm Rohan, a computer science student at UCLA. My main interests are machine learning/deep learning, running, playing chess, reading, and writing. I maintain a list of my favorite reads and some of my more interesting writes. 

I enjoy working on machine learning and deep learning problems, whether it's learning about probabalistic models, implementing algorithms, or figuring out how to scale up a machine learning system. 

Currently, I'm the president of ACM AI at UCLA, an organization that teaches regular workshops on a variety of machine-learning related topics, most recently a series on Tensorflow (we also discuss ML papers and courses together). I am also a project manager for UCLA DevX, leading a small team of developers and designers on a quarter-long project to apply machine learning to create a class recommender system. 

I am also a consultant at Bruin Consulting. Bruin Consulting is a 501 (c) 3 organization run by UCLA Students that does management consulting for several different clients, including Fortune 500 companies such as Northwestern Mutual, Amazon, and Toyota, as well as local startups such as ChowNow and Boxfox. 

Previously I was a machine learning researcher at UCLA's Ozcan Lab for five quarters of my undergraduate time, where I implemented the lab's first deep learning models that were used to automatically diagnose bloodborne and waterborne pathogen disease. The infrastructure I built for configuring and training models is still in use by other researchers. I also had the opportunity to show graduate students how deep learning could be applied in their research. 

I was also previously a DevOps Director for UCLA ACM, where I was responsible for helping build out a few tools such as the general website and hack website. Before that, I was a web developer for the Daily Bruin where I learned about front-end web development. 

Other than that, I am a part of Upsilon Pi Epsilon and the Regents Scholars Society at UCLA. 

### Internships

I had the awesome opportunity to work as a software engineering intern on the messaging squad at Hudl in the summer of 2016. Over the summer of 2017, I will be a software engineering intern at Blend in San Francisco.
