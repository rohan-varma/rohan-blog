Hi, I'm Rohan, a computer science student at UCLA. My main interests are machine learning/deep learning, mathematics, running, playing chess, reading, and writing.

I enjoy working on machine learning and deep learning problems, whether it's learning about probabalistic models, implementing algorithms, or figuring out how to scale up a machine learning system. 

Currently, I'm the president of ACM AI at UCLA, an organization that teaches regular workshops on a variety of machine-learning related topics, most recently a series on Tensorflow (we also discuss ML papers and courses together). 

I am also a consultant at Bruin Consulting. Bruin Consulting is a 501 (c) 3 organization run by UCLA Students that does management consulting for several different clients, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to hyper-growth startups. My personal goal with Bruin Consulting is to learn more about the problems that a wide range of businesses face, and understand how my skills with software engineering, data science, and project management can be used to solve real-world problems.

Previously I was a machine learning researcher at UCLA's Ozcan Lab for five quarters of my undergraduate time, where I implemented the lab's first deep learning models that were used to automatically diagnose bloodborne and waterborne pathogen disease. The infrastructure I built for configuring and training models is still in use by other researchers. I also had the opportunity to show graduate students how deep learning could be applied in their research. 

I was also previously a DevOps Director for UCLA ACM, where I was responsible for helping build out a few tools such as the general website and hack website. Before that, I was a web developer for the Daily Bruin where I learned about front-end web development. 

Other than that, I am a part of Upsilon Pi Epsilon and the Regents Scholars Society at UCLA. 

### Internships

I had the awesome opportunity to work as a software engineering intern on the messaging squad at Hudl in the summer of 2016. Over the summer of 2017, I will be a software engineering intern at Blend in San Francisco. 

### Reading
I am an avid reader, of both technical and non-technical books. The following is a list of the books I am hoping to read in 2017. The completed ones also have links to the key insights I gained from the books.

### Writing
I have enjoyed writing since high school, but didnd't get much of a chance to do it in college until I started to actively pursue it. I frequently write on Quora, on my blog, and occassionaly on Medium. Below is a list of the favorite things I've written.
