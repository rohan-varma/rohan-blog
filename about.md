Hi! I'm Rohan. I recently graduated with a BS in Computer Science from UCLA, and work as a software engineer. My main interests are software engineering, machine learning, math, running, playing chess, reading, and writing. I'm originally from San Jose, California.

### Work

I currently work at [Facebook AI](http://ai.facebook.com/) on enabling large-scale distributed training within the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework. I've recently been working on helping build out [model parallelism](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/rpc_param_server_tutorial.html) support within PyTorch, as well as investigating the scalability of [data parallel training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15704). 

### Writings
