Hi! I'm Rohan, a computer science student at UCLA. My main interests are software engineering, machine learning, math, running, playing chess, reading, and writing. I'm originally from San Jose, California.

### Work

I will be joining [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/) as a software engineer in August 2019.

### Internships

Previously, I have worked at [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/), [Affirm](http://affirm.com), [Blend](http://blend.com), and [Hudl](http://hudl.com) in software engineering/machine learning roles.

### Research

From Fall 2015 to Winter 2018, I was an undergraduate machine learning researcher at [UCLA's Ozcan Research Group](http://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/), where I worked on deep learning models that were used to diagnose bloodborne and waterborne pathogen disease. Our group's work in the form of an abstract was presented at UCLA's Annual Undergraduate Research Day and a few other conferences. A [poster](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/aWOGsmotZPmdGg) and [abstract](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/5pWzzCrbE4oQxI) are available. 

### Writing
I have enjoyed writing since high school, and I exercise that enjoyment on [Quora](http://quora.com/Rohan-Varma-8) and this blog. Below is a list of my favorite pieces I've written. 

1. [Getting Started in Machine Learning](https://medium.com/techatucla/getting-started-in-machine-learning-c68bdd739c44)

2. [My answer to "Why is the 0-1 loss a poor choice of loss function?](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-0-1-indicator-function-a-poor-choice-for-loss-function/answer/Rohan-Varma-8)

3. [An explanation of kernelized Support Vector Machines](https://www.quora.com/What-are-C-and-gamma-with-regards-to-a-support-vector-machine)

4. [What is it like to be a Computer Science Student at UCLA?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-UCLA)

5. [What are the most promising startups to watch in 2017?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-promising-Silicon-Valley-startups-to-watch-for-in-2017/answer/Rohan-Varma-8)

6. [Welcome to AI at UCLA!](https://medium.com/techatucla/welcome-to-ai-at-ucla-f10927043301)

7. [Scaled ML Notes and Thoughts](https://medium.com/@rvarm1/scaled-ml-2017-thoughts-takeaways-fafc82ee4bb6)

### Explanations/Tutorials
I've found that one of the best ways to learn something is by being able to explain it, so I've tried to do that in the following posts.

1. [Word2Vec and Language Modeling](http://rohanvarma.me/Word2Vec/) and [discussion on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15578788)

2. [Bias and Variance in Machine Learning](http://rohanvarma.me/Regularization/)

3. [Tensorflow workshop series](http://github.com/uclaacmai/tf-workshop-series/) to which all other AI officers contributed to.

4. [Implementing a Neural Network in Python](http://rohanvarma.me/Neural-Net/)

### Misc
I try to keep [this page](http://rohanvarma.me/ideas/) updated somewhat regularly with some ideas for projects/products that I've had.
