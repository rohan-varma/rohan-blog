Hi! I'm Rohan. I recently graduated with a BS in Computer Science from UCLA, and work as a software engineer at Facebook. My main interests are software engineering, machine learning, math, running, playing chess, reading, and writing. I'm originally from San Jose, California.

### Work

I currently work at [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/) as a software engineer.

### Internships

Previously, I worked at [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/), [Affirm](https://affirm.com), [Blend](https://blend.com), and [Hudl](https://hudl.com) in software engineering/machine learning roles.

### Research

From Fall 2015 to Winter 2018, I was an undergraduate machine learning researcher at [UCLA's Ozcan Research Group](https://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/), where I worked on deep learning models that were used to diagnose bloodborne and waterborne pathogen disease.

### Writing
I write about things on this blog, [Quora](https://quora.com/Rohan-Varma-8), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@rvarm1). Below is a list of my favorite pieces I've written. 

1. [Getting Started in Machine Learning](https://medium.com/techatucla/getting-started-in-machine-learning-c68bdd739c44)

2. [My answer to "Why is the 0-1 loss a poor choice of loss function?](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-0-1-indicator-function-a-poor-choice-for-loss-function/answer/Rohan-Varma-8)

3. [An explanation of kernelized Support Vector Machines](https://www.quora.com/What-are-C-and-gamma-with-regards-to-a-support-vector-machine)

4. [What is it like to be a Computer Science Student at UCLA?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-be-a-computer-science-student-at-UCLA)

5. [What are the most promising startups to watch in 2017?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-promising-Silicon-Valley-startups-to-watch-for-in-2017/answer/Rohan-Varma-8)

6. [Welcome to AI at UCLA!](https://medium.com/techatucla/welcome-to-ai-at-ucla-f10927043301)

7. [Scaled ML Notes and Thoughts](https://medium.com/@rvarm1/scaled-ml-2017-thoughts-takeaways-fafc82ee4bb6)

### Explanations/Tutorials
I've found that one of the best ways to learn something is by being able to explain it, so I've tried to do that in the following posts.

1. [Word2Vec and Language Modeling](https://rohanvarma.me/Word2Vec/) and [discussion on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15578788)

2. [Bias and Variance in Machine Learning](https://rohanvarma.me/Regularization/)

3. [Tensorflow workshop series](https://github.com/uclaacmai/tf-workshop-series/) to which all other AI officers contributed to.

4. [Implementing a Neural Network in Python](https://rohanvarma.me/Neural-Net/)

### Misc

My reading list can be found [here](https://rohanvarma.me/reads/). I try to keep [this page](https://rohanvarma.me/ideas/) updated somewhat regularly with some ideas for projects/products that I've had.
