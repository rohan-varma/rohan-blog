Hi, I'm Rohan, a computer science student at UCLA. My main interests are machine learning/deep learning, mathematics, running, playing chess, reading, and writing.

I enjoy working on machine learning and deep learning problems, whether it's learning about probabalistic models, implementing algorithms, or figuring out how to scale up a machine learning system. 

I currently run [AI at UCLA](https://github.com/uclaacmai/), a committee of the umbrella organization [ACM at UCLA](http://acm.cs.ucla.edu). We teach machine learning topics through regular workshops as well as work on projects and read papers and books together. Most of our work is currently in deep learning. This past spring, we hosted a series of weekly Tensorflow workshops that had 80+ attendees. 

### Internships

I had the awesome opportunity to work as a software engineering intern on the messaging squad at Hudl in the summer of 2016. Over the summer of 2017, I will be a software engineering intern at Blend in San Francisco.

### Additional Involvement

For five quarters of my undergraduate time, I was an undergraduate researcher at UCLA's Ozcan Lab, where I implemented the lab's first deep learnign models that were used to automatically diagnose bloodborne and waterborne pathogen disease. The infrastructure I built for configuring and training deep model is still in use by other researchers. I also had the opportunity to show other graduate students and postdocs how deep learning could be applied to their research. My work was presented at UCLA's Annual Undergraduate Research Day, the 17th Annual UC Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium at UCSF, and at the Southern California Conferences for Undergraduate Research. 

I am also currently consultant at Bruin Consulting. Bruin Consulting is a 501 (c) 3 organization run by UCLA Students that does management consulting for several different clients, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to hyper-growth startups. My personal goal with Bruin Consulting is to learn more about the problems that a wide range of businesses face, and understand how my skills with software engineering, data science, and project management can be used to solve real-world problems.


I was also previously a DevOps Director for UCLA ACM, where I was responsible for helping build out a few tools such as the general website and hack website. Before that, I was a web developer for the Daily Bruin where I learned about front-end web development. 

Other than that, I am a part of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon CS honor society and the Regents Scholars Society at UCLA. 



### Reading
I am an avid reader, of both technical and non-technical books.

### Writing
I have enjoyed writing since high school, but didn't get much of a chance to do it in college until I started to actively pursue it. I frequently write on Quora, on my blog, and occassionaly on Medium. Below is a list of the favorite things I've written.
