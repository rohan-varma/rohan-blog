Hi! I'm Rohan, a computer science student at UCLA. My main interests are machine learning/deep learning, mathematics, running, playing chess, reading, and writing. I'm originally from San Jose, California.

### Internships

I had the awesome opportunity to work as a software engineering intern on the messaging squad at [Hudl](http://hudl.com) in the summer of 2016. I worked mostly on the backend, and shipped several messaging services that other microservices could use. I also learned a lot about effective communication, clean code, source control, and safely deploying to production. I am especially thankful to my mentors [Andy Pryor](https://github.com/andypryor) and [Graham McCulloch](https://github.com/grahammcculloch) who taught me a lot.

Over the summer of 2017, I will be a software engineering intern at [Blend](http://blend.com) in San Francisco.

### Other Experiences

With the help of several officers, I currently run [AI at UCLA](https://github.com/uclaacmai/), a committee of the umbrella organization [ACM at UCLA](http://acm.cs.ucla.edu). We teach machine learning topics through regular workshops as well as work on projects and read papers and books together. Most of our work is currently in deep learning. This past spring, we hosted a series of weekly [Tensorflow workshops](http://github.com/uclaacmai/tf-workshop-series/) that had 80+ attendees. 

From Fall 2015 to Winter 2017, I was an undergraduate researcher at [UCLA's Ozcan Research Group](http://innovate.ee.ucla.edu/), where I implemented the lab's first deep learning models that were used to automatically diagnose bloodborne and waterborne pathogen disease. My work was presented at UCLA's Annual Undergraduate Research Day, the 17th Annual UC Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium at UCSF, and at the Southern California Conferences for Undergraduate Research. A [poster](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/aWOGsmotZPmdGg) and [abstract](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/5pWzzCrbE4oQxI) are available. 

Other than that, I tutor lower division computer science classes as a part of [Upsilon Pi Epsilon](http://upe.seas.ucla.edu), host potential UCLA freshman as part of an outreach program by UCLA's [Regents Scholars Society](http://www.rssla.org/), and work on consulting projects as a member of [Bruin Consulting](http://bruinconsulting.org).

### Personal Projects

I occassionally work on projects mostly in the field of machine learning and deep learning to learn more about the field and how to use what I've learned in practice. Some of my more interesting projects are [Machine Learning on Movie Reviews](https://github.com/rohan-varma/word2vec), a hackathon project that dealt with [identifying similar athletes](https://github.com/rohan-varma/awesome-athletes), a [bare-bones implementation of a Neural Network](https://github.com/rohan-varma/neuralnets), and a [machine learning library](https://github.com/rohan-varma/ml-algorithms) in Python. 

Other in progress and miscellaneous projects are on my [Github](https://github.com/rohan-varma).
