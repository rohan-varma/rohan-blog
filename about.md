Hi, I'm Rohan Varma, a second year Computer Science student at UCLA. I'm interested in machine learning, math, running, writing, and reading, among other things. 

### More Information

Last summer, I worked as a software engineering intern at Hudl. I have also worked at UCLA's Bio and Nano-Photonics Laboratory as a machine learning researcher. This year, I am an officer for ACM, UCLA's premier Computer Science club, and I also help out with ACM Hack, a committee of ACM that is focused on teaching skills such as iOS, Android, and web development to students, as well as fostering a hacking culture in the UCLA CS community. Outside of classes, I'm also part of Foundations Choreography, a beginner dance club at UCLA.
