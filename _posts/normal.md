#### A short note on deriving the normal equations

We have some observed data $$ X $$ where $$ X $$ is an $$ n x m $$ matrix, and we assume that we have have $$ n > m $$, so that we have more observations than parameters to fit. We wish to fit a linear model of the form $$ \hat{y}= X\theta$$ to approximate the true dependent variable $$ y $$. 

To do this, we wish to minimize the sum of squared errors:
