This highlights the difference between prediction and inference in probability theory: given an average patient, you can predict that a COVID-19 test will produce the "right" result with high probability (90% for both sick and well patients), but are much less confident with regard to inference: given a positive test, you are not confident about inferring a true diagnosis.
