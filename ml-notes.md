These are some machine learning notes, thoughts, tips & tricks that I've collected throughout the years of my studies. Some of them are from [Introduction to Machine Learning](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~sriram/courses/cs188.winter-2017/html/index.html) and [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://seas.ucla.edu/~kao/nndl/) taken at UCLA. Others are from various online courses such as [Stanford's CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), or books such as the [deep learning book](http://deeplearningbook.org). 

Please send me a [pull request](http://google.com) if you find any mistakes, inaccuracies, or points that could be clarified better!
